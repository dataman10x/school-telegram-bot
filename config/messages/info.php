<blockquote>
From primary, secondary, and tertiary education to vocational certification, every form of education and training requires optimized and measurable assessments to measure the outcomes of knowledge imparted to learners. Assessments have long been employed for the evaluation process. Well-designed assessments focus on targeted areas with utmost accuracy and encourage learners to perform better. Before the digital era, evaluators used traditional approach-based tests. However, with the internet and technology seeping into different aspects of life and computing gadgets becoming a necessity, assessments are also becoming increasingly crucial.

CBT provides a scaffold by minimizing the administrative burden of conducting examinations in academia, reducing the time and effort that would otherwise be consumed on the laborious process of setting up examination centers, printing and distributing exam papers, and other overheads.

Some common types of CBTs are:

* Multiple-choice tests: These tests present a question or statement with multiple answer options, and the test taker selects the correct answer(s) from the given choices.

* Fill-in-the-blank tests: The test taker must provide the missing word or phrase to complete a sentence or statement in these tests.

* True or false tests: Test takers are presented with statements and must determine whether each piece of information is true or false.

* Simulations: Simulations are interactive computer-based tests that mimic real-life scenarios. They assess practical skills and decision-making abilities in various fields, such as healthcare, aviation, and engineering.

* Essay tests: Essay tests require test takers to write detailed responses to questions or prompts. They are often used to evaluate writing skills, critical thinking, and subject knowledge.
