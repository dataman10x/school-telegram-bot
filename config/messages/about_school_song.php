<blockquote><b>1.</b> God is with us, God is with us,
So our brave forefathers sang,
Far across the field of battle
Loud their holy war-cry rang
Never once they feared nor faltered
Never once they ceased to sing,
God is with us, God is with us,
Christ our Lord shall reign as King!</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>2.</b> God is with us, God is with us
In Samuel Adegbite
Anglican College our great School
Life is in transformation
Our heart receive the strength of God
and move to great lofty height,
Souls are shapen, lives transforming
Christ our Lord shall reign as King.</blockquote>
